# TrackPractice

This is a multi-user practice tracker for musicians. It allows you to track when you practice, how much time you put in,
the focus of each practice, and, if you are working on a song, the song you are practicing. It maintains an at-a-glance
display of your practices for the week and a graph of your practice time for the month, along with navigation to prior
weeks. If you are practicing every day, it lets you know how long you have maintained your streak of uninterrupted
practices.

When you register a new user, you will start with a short list of guitar-oriented foci. You can add, edit or delete
foci and songs. You can enter lyrics and chords for your songs. When you select a song for a practice, you will see its
lyrics and chords.
